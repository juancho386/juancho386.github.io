# Guide to Buenos Aires
This is an honest and uncensored guide created with the intention of make HX collegues have a good experience while traveling to Buenos Aires using the Friends and Family benefit with Antarctica destination. If you have a few extra days in Buenos Aires prior or post the vessel trip, you might want some secrets. The guide is formatted with bullet points to make easier to navigate through different topics and aspects.

## Who created the guide:
Juan is Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires for about 35 years. Moved to Europe in 2015 and keeps constant communication with his family there.

### Airport
- General
  - The airport is 35km from the city.
  - The area is not particularly friendly. Don’t leave the airport to explore the surroundings.
  - Uber is better idea than Taxi since Taxis are not really regulated nor controlled
  - “Tienda Leon” is reliable and cheap. You can save maybe 200 usd by getting closer to your destination using this bus
  - The airport’s name is Ministro Pistarini. But locals barely know that name. If you need to refer to the airport, just say Ezeiza
-	Arrival
  - Right before exit the airport, there is a drugstore where you can get a local SIM card and probably a SUBE card for the public transport (if you plan to move as a local)
  - If you dare to travel like a local, the local bus number 8 starts right at the airport entrance and can take you to the center of Buenos Aires downtown. It is the cheapest and not recommended for small groups unless you know what you are doing. Have in mind that will need a SUBE card (more about that later)
-	Departure
  - There are 4 terminals (buildings)
  - There is no internal communication between them like in Europe airports.
  - If you arrive to the wrong terminal, you will have to walk outside of the airport even if it’s raining.
  - Always make your luggage wrapped with plastic. It is common to have open bags or missing content on the destination
### Currency
  - The local currency is Peso
  - Locals love US Dolars and Euros because they can make a difference on the exchange in the cuevas (see bellow)
  - Any other currency is almost unknown for the locals
  - If you dare to go adventurous, ask for local “cuevas” where you can exchange at a better rate. Bear in mind that the cuevas are not legal but commonly used
### Transport
  - Any public transport requires a SUBE card which is a prepaid card that you use inside the transport to get your ticket.
    - As far as I remember, you can buy it in the airport and charge it right there.
  -	SUBE card works on bus, metro and local area trains
  -	Taxi is not really recommended
  -	Uber could be a good idea if you are not in the downtown (because of traffic)
  -	Subway is great choice to move fast along the entire city
