# Guide to Buenos Aires
[< Back](./README.md)
## Interesting places to visit
This is a quick guide of places I personally like from my city. But probably you can get more custom places on Google. But if you have very short time for your visit, you might seriously think on these list:
- [El Ateneo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NcHkQHEiwWLeSpwp8): It is just a book store. But very long time ago used to be one of the most impressive theatres in the world. 
- [El Malba](): If you are into Art Museums, this is a must-visit Art Museum. Sorry that I am not much into art. I never went myself. But everybody talks about it in Buenos Aires. Yes, even locally.
- [Obelisco](): This is a must-have photo of Buenos Aires. It is just an Obelisc like many others, but for us it represents a lot of things. For example, every time Argentina wins a world cup of anything, the party is there. Also is one of the most neuralgic spots of Buenos Aires. For long time, the spot where the Obelisco is, was considered the widest avenue in the world. Bellow it, there are 3 subway stations, a bus terminal which used to be a parking garage for more than 600 cars back in the 90s, and a Feria you can walk and buy souvenirs.
