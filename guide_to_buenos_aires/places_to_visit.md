## Interesting places to visit
This is a quick guide of places I personally like from my city. But probably you can get more custom places on Google. But if you have very short time for your visit, you might seriously think on these list:
- El Ateneo
- El Malba
- Obelisco
- Plaza de Mayo / Casa Rosada
- Teatro ColÃ³n
- Puerto Madero
- Recoleta - Feria de Artesanos
- Cancha de Boca
- Cancha de River
