# Guide to Buenos Aires
This is an honest and uncensored guide created with the intention of make HX collegues have a good experience while traveling to Buenos Aires using the Friends and Family benefit with Antarctica destination. If you have a few extra days in Buenos Aires prior or post the vessel trip, you might want some secrets. The guide is formatted with bullet points to make easier to navigate through different topics and aspects. To make your life easier, I will write the pronunciation between parentesis next to the spanish words, unless it doesn't require it.

## Who created the guide:
Juan is Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires for about 35 years. Moved to Europe in 2015 and keeps constant communication with his family there.

### Airport
- General
  - The airport is 35km from the city.
  - The area is not particularly friendly. Don't leave the airport to explore the surroundings.
  - Uber is better idea than Taxi since Taxis are not really regulated nor controlled.
  - "Tienda Leon" is reliable and cheap. You can save maybe 200 usd by getting closer to your destination using its bus.
  - The airport's name is Ministro Pistarini. But locals barely know that name. If you need to refer to the airport, just say Ezeiza
- Arrival
  - Right before exit the airport, there is a drugstore where you can get a local SIM card and probably a SUBE card for the public transport (if you plan to move as a local)
  - If you dare to travel like a local, the local bus number 8 starts right at the airport entrance and can take you to the center of Buenos Aires downtown. It is the cheapest and not recommended for small groups unless you know what you are doing. Have in mind that will need a SUBE card (more about that later)
- Departure
  - Have in mind the distance from the city to calculate the transport time. A normal bus takes around 2 hours from the city to the airport.
    - So make your math to leave the hotel with enough time. (Personally, I go 4 hours earlier. Two for the bus and 2 for the luggage handling)
  - Check which is your terminal. There are 4 terminals (buildings)
    - There is no internal communication between them like in Europe airports.
    - If you arrive to the wrong terminal, you will have to walk outside of the airport even if it's raining.
  - Always make your luggage wrapped with plastic. It is common to have open bags or missing content on the destination

### Currency
- The local currency is Pesos
- Locals love US Dolars and Euros because they can make a difference on the exchange in the cuevas (see bellow)
- Any other currency is almost unknown for the locals
- If you dare to go adventurous, ask for local "cuevas" where you can exchange at a better rate. Bear in mind that the cuevas are not legal but commonly used
- Fake currency was not common. But ChatGPT says that now a days it could be.
- If you need to, use only ATM machines that are inside the banks

### Transport
- Any public transport requires a SUBE card which is a prepaid card that you use inside the transport to get your ticket.
  - As far as I remember, you can buy it at the airport and charge it right there.
- SUBE card works on bus, metro and local area trains
- Taxi is not really recommended
- Uber could be a good idea if you are not in the downtown (because of traffic)
- Subway is great choice to move fast along the entire city
- If you want to take a bus, there are a little list of single rules:
  - The bus will not stop unless the people on the bus stop rises the hand. Usually the first person does it. Don't be affraid of what it looks like when you rise your hand.
  - Argentinians respect queue and lines.
  - To get into the bus use the front door only.
  - Pregnate and seniors always has priority. If you don't want to be yeled, offer your sit, let them go first, and offer them your hand to desend.
  - Desend only using the middle and last door. Any but the first. Even if technically you can desend by the first door, if takes you more than 2 seconds, you will be yealled at.
  - The bus does not stop unless the stop is requested. Be ready to ring the bell at least 100m before your stop.
  - Equilibrium and good grabbing reflex are not overrated. Some bus drivers drives really reclesly. Could not be your case, but be prepared for some adrenaline.
  - While traveling, backpacks needs to be on the front. If you have it on your back, don't be surprised to find it open or cut when you reach your destination.

### Walking the city
- If you have extra time before your trip, watch "nueve reinas" (nine queens). It's an argentinian movie that describes how you can be robbed. From pick pockets and runners, up to violent assaults. Follow a little list of simple rules and you will be safe.
  - Stay at the north of the city. The southern people do not expect turists.
  - Avoid walking and watching your phone. Specially if you are close to the edge of the sidewalk.
  - Wallets and phones goes in the internal pockets. Never outside pockets.
  - Do not flash money, big rings, expensive phones (iphones), (smart) watches, etc. Try to show no values.
  - The most common scams starts with a woman approaching you and offering tango shows or any other cliche. Just say "No, Gracias" (No, thank you) and keep walking.
  - Try to use your handbag diagonally crossed as possible.
- Car drivers believes they have priority. Even if you are stanging on the white lines ready to cross the street, if there is no traffic light, always wait until the cars passes.
- During the night, traffic lights are "only a suggestion"
- Drugstores are called "Kioskos". They have literally everything and most of them are open until very late.
- Insults are common but almost never with bad intentions: Depend on what you are being told is how serious it gets. As a general rule, single words are not serious. Try to read the face expresions. You can call 'boludo' a person and depending on the context could be a compliment or an insult. But there are other that will never be heard as compliment like 'cornudo' (kornudo)

### Eating
- Restaurants
  - Carritos de la Costanera
  - Siga la Vaca

### Interesting places to visit
This is a quick guide of places I personally like from my city. But probably you can get more custom places on Google:

- El Malba
- Obelisco
- Plaza de Mayo / Casa Rosada
- Teatro Colón
- Puerto Madero
- Recoleta - Feria de Artesanos
- Cancha de Boca
- Cancha de River

### Language: Spanish
The oficial language is Spanish with a weird accent for people that are not used to it.
- We do not differenciate the sound of S and Z. And also C when it is followed by E or I.
- If C is followed by an H it sounds like in Chocolate.
- If C is followed by any other letter, sounds like K.
- J sounds like a very strong English H
- G also sounds like a very strong English H when it's followed by E or I
- H does not sound at all. Just forget you see it. Except If it has a C before it (see above)
- We do not differenciate the sound between V and B. It sounds always like B
- Q must be always followed by U. And together sounds like K
- R at the beginning of the word sounds stronger. The same sound at the middle of the word requires "RR"
