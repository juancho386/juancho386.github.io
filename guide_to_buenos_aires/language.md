# Guide to Buenos Aires
[< back](./README.md)

This is a quick guide for people that never tried to speak spanish before. I am leaving some terms that I think are going to be usefull. I also write the pronounsation between parentesis with the closest to English I can. Enjoy it :)

## Language: Spanish
The oficial language is Spanish with a weird accent for people that are not used to it.
- We do not differenciate the sound of S and Z. And also C when it is followed by E or I.
- If C is followed by an H it sounds like in Chocolate.
- If C is followed by any other letter, sounds like K.
- J sounds like a very strong English H
- G also sounds like a very strong English H when it's followed by E or I
- H does not sound at all. Just forget you see it. Except If it has a C before it (see above)
- We do not differenciate the sound between V and B. It sounds always like B
- Q must be always followed by U. And together sounds like K
- R at the beginning of the word sounds stronger. The same sound at the middle of the word requires "RR". Don't try too hard. We understand it despiste how strong you pronunce it.
- Doble L (ll) in Buenos Aires sounds like English SH
