# Guide to Buenos Aires
[< back](./README.md)

This is a quick guide for people that never tried to speak spanish before. I am leaving some terms that I think are going to be usefull. I also write the pronounsation between parentesis with the closest to English I can. Enjoy it :)

## Language: Spanish
The oficial language is Spanish with a weird accent for people that are not used to it.
- We do not differenciate the sound of S and Z like the Spanish from Spain. And also C when it is followed by E or I has the same sound.
- If C is followed by an H it sounds like in Chocolate.
- If C is followed by any other letter, sounds like K.
- J sounds like a very strong English H.
- G also sounds like a very strong English H when it's followed by E or I.
- H does not sound at all. Do not try to pronounce it like in English because people might be confused. Just forget you see it. Except If it has a C before it (see above).
- We do not differenciate the sound between V and B. It always sounds like B.
- Q must be always followed by U. And together sounds like K.
- R at the beginning of the word sounds stronger. The same sound at the middle of the word requires "RR". It is a diffucult sound to pronounce but don't try too hard. We understand it despiste how strong you pronunce it.
- Doble L (ll) in Buenos Aires sounds like English SH.
- Y at the beginning of the word or in the middle, also sounds like SH. If it is at the end, sounds like an "i" (English "e")
