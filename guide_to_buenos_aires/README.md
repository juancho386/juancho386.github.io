# Guide to Buenos Aires
This is an honest and uncensored guide created with the intention of make HX collegues have a good experience while traveling to Buenos Aires using the Friends and Family benefit with Antarctica destination. If you have a few extra days in Buenos Aires prior or post the vessel trip, you might want some secrets. The guide is formatted with bullet points to make easier to navigate through different topics and aspects. To make your life easier, I will write the pronunciation between parentesis next to the spanish words, unless it doesn't require it.

## Who created the guide:
- Juan is Argentinian and lived in Buenos Aires for about 35 years. Moved to Europe in 2015 and keeps constant communication with his family there.

So, let's get to it....


## Buenos Aires
Buenos Aires is a beautiful city. It only has ~200 years old. Its demonym is "Porteño". Its architecture is borrowed from Europe. The comon porteño is very passionate compared to the standard european and because of that, are notorious around the world. Basically because it's standard to talk very loud and some times move the hands and arms excesively while having a conversation.

### Airport
- General
  - It is located [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dJMdGh1DkvmTPpND9)
  - The airport is 35km from the city.
  - The area is not particularly friendly. Don't leave the airport to explore the surroundings.
  - Uber is better idea than Taxi since Taxis are not really regulated nor controlled.
  - If you still prefer taxi, check the Airport-Taxi desk right outside the arrival doors. On December 2026, the price was between 35k and 55k (Argentinian Pesos)
  - "Tienda Leon" is reliable and cheap. You can save up to 200 usd of a scam taxi by getting closer to your destination using this bus.
  - The airport's name is Ministro Pistarini. But locals barely know that name. If you need to refer to the airport, just say Ezeiza (a-say-sah)
- Arrival
  - Right before exit the airport, there is a drugstore on your left where you can get a local SIM card and probably a SUBE card for the public transport (if you plan to move as a local). If you plan to move only with fixed transport, you will not need a SUBE card.
  - If you dare to travel like a local, the local bus number 8 starts right at the airport entrance and can take you to the center of Buenos Aires downtown. It is the cheapest way to travel but it is not really recommended for small groups that does not know what you are doing. Have in mind that will need a SUBE card (more about that later).
- Departure
  - Have in mind the distance from the city to calculate the transport time. A normal bus takes around 2 hours from the city to the airport.
    - So make your math to leave the hotel with enough time. (Personally, I go 4 hours earlier. Two for the bus and 2 for the luggage handling and customs)
  - Always make your luggage wrapped with plastic. It is common to have open bags or missing content on the destination

### Currency
Currency should be a simple thing, I know. But in Argentina is a world of economic concepts and some people thinks that you need a college degree to understand it. In any case, [here](./currency.md) I left a little guide for you. I hope it get's useful.

### Transport
- Any public transport requires a [SUBE](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/servicio/consegui-la-tarjeta-sube) card which is a prepaid card that you use inside the transport to get your ticket.
  - As far as I remember, you can buy it at the airport and charge it at any [Kiosko](#eating).
- The SUBE card works on bus, metro and local area trains
- Taxi is not really recommended due internal mafia-like organizations. Their trip is not monitored, and they have really a lot of tricks to scam the passager. There are stories about taxi drivers faking getting robbed so the passager give the thief all their belongs, and after the Taxi driver leave you at the police station, they go back to get their share.
- Uber could be a good idea if you are not in the downtown (because of traffic)
- Subway (we call it Subte - short for Sub-terraneo) is great choice to move fast along the entire city. [Here](https://subtebuenosaires.com.ar/mapa/) is the main website with the station's map.
  - The northern you go, the more touristic.
  - The light-blue line (Line A) separates North / South areas of Buenos Aires.
  - There are very few interesting points at the south and it is more dangerous.
- If you want to take a bus, there are a little list of single rules:
  - If you are waiting for a bus, note that the bus driver will not stop at you unless you rise your hand (the first person on the line must do it). Germans could feel unconfortable with the hand signal but we do not relate to their history. Don't be affraid of what it looks like when you rise your hand.
  - If you are on the bus, note that the bus driver us will not stop unless the somebody press the stop button. Do it at least 100 mts (one street) before your destination. Otherwise the bus will stop on the next stop and you will have to walk about 200 mts backwards.
  - Argentinians respect queue and lines and might get mad at you if they were waiting since before your arrival and you get on the transport first.
  - To get into the bus use the front door only. Is where the ticket machine is.
  - Tell the driver the destination and approach the SUBE card to the reader. 
  - Pregnate and seniors always has priority. If you don't want to be yeled, offer your sit, let them go first, and offer them your hand to desend. Good maners are a must.
  - Desend by any door except the front door. Even if technically you can desend by the first door, if takes you more than 2 seconds, you will be yealled at.
  - It is forbiden by law to talk to the bus driver but if you feel really lost, she would help anyway. But do not expect them to understand any other language than Spanish.
  - Equilibrium and good grabbing reflex are not overrated. Some bus drivers drives really reclesly. It depends on their mood on that day, so it could not be your case. But just in case be prepared for some adrenaline.
  - While traveling, backpacks should not stay at your back. Put it on the floor or even better, keep it at your chest grabbing it firmly with your arm around it. If you have it on your back, don't be surprised to find it open or cut when you reach your destination.
  - Avoid checking your phone while traveling. Specially if you are sit close to a door. There is a common technic thieves uses to steal phones and run out the bus.

### Walking the city
- If you have extra time before your trip, watch "nueve reinas" [Nine Queens](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247586/). It's an argentinian movie that describes how you can be robbed. From pick pockets and runners, up to violent assaults. Follow a little list of simple rules and you will be safe.
  - Stay at the north of the city. The southern people do not expect turists.
  - Avoid walking and watching your phone at the same time. Specially if you are close to the edge of the sidewalk. Bickers can steal your phone without even reducing their speed.
  - Wallets and phones goes in the internal pockets. Never outside pockets.
  - Do not flash money, big rings, expensive phones (specially iphones), (smart) watches, etc. Try to show no values.
  - The most common scams starts with a woman approaching you and offering tango shows or any other cliche. Just say "No, Gracias" (No, thank you) and keep walking. If you engage in a conversation you are already falling in their trap.
  - Try to use your handbag strap diagonally crossed as possible. Runner thieves do not even try when they see you well handled.
- Car drivers believes they have priority. Even if you are stepping on the street, standing on the white lines ready to cross it, if there is no traffic light, always wait until the cars passes.
  - Always look at the driver's hands through their glass. Specially professionals (bus, taxi, trucks, etc) will make a hand gesture telling you "pass" when they "allow you" to pass. Yes. it is crazy. I know.
  - Rising the hand saying "thank you" to the vehicle driver when they let you cross is well seen. Even when theoretically and legally you have priority.
- During the night, traffic lights are "only a suggestion". Cross avenues at accelerated step of even running is common. Depending on the area, cars will not even reduce their speed on a red light because they can also be robbed and they are affraid.
- Drugstores are called "Kioskos". They have literally everything and most of them are open until very late.
- Insults are common but almost never with bad intentions: Depend on what you are being told is how serious it gets. As a general rule, single words are not serious. Try to read the face expresions more than listening the words. You can call 'boludo' a person and depending on the context could be a compliment or an insult. But there are other insults that will never be heard as compliment like 'cornudo' (kornudo)

### Eating

Buenos Aires is well known for the meat. There are fancy restaurants everywhere, some of them are well known by turists, other by locals, and very few of them by both.

#### Meat
- Argentinian way to cut meat is very different than the european way.
- if you are not familiar with Argentinian cuts, ask for a "parrillada para N personas" (parrishada). N is the amount of people that will eat. They make the math. It is usually about 500 grams per person distributed in several pieces of meat. Try them all without asking what part of the cow is.
- Pick a food truck from the [Costanera Sur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G6eXvPX5HvL2AMN19), you can get the best street food in the world. Ask for "Un chivito". Thank me later.
- [Siga La Vaca](): Meat specialiced restaurant very famous among locals.

### Empanadas
- Even though around the world empanadas are common, people might want to try "the original ones".
- Turistically, the way of "closing" the empanada is a fancy decoration. Locally, all are closed very similarly. The variation is inside.
- A common empanadas place has from 10 to 30 different types.
- Originals are big. A normal person can eat between 2 and 5. Generally I go with 3. 4 when I am starving.
- There are also "sweet" empanadas that historically were desert for kids. Not common in other places of the world. Definitevily worth to try. Go with "Dulce de Membrillo" and "Dulce de Batata". The "Dulce de Leche" version is not in the original culture. It is turistic but it's very nice too.
- Chains of Empanadas:

  - [Solo Empanadas](http://soloempanadas.com/)

#### Pizza
- Even though pizza is not an argentinian cliché, we have our version which porteños (and me) consider it is even better than ANY other pizza. Including italian.
- We have thick and spongee versions we call "Media Masa" or "Al Molde" and flat and crunchy versions which we call "a la piedra". Be mindful of that before order. But even the thiniest argentinian pizza is WAY thicker than almost any european pizza.
- Argentinians exhagerates with everything they can, so do not expect to be able to finish one pizza by yourself like with the italian pizza. It is just not possible. We share. Depend on the size, one pizza is for 2, 3 or 4 persons.
- There are more combinations than any other country I visited so far. If you want to try something new and you feel adventurous, ask for "pizza de palmitos" (one of my favorites)
- Here is a list of my favorite places:
  - [El Cuartito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tda3HovMqDH8F2Sd7): Legendary pizza place where a lot of history. The walls are decorated with original pieces of argentinian history.
  - [Las Cuartetas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vcgBgigkH9S1KPkg6): Standard Pizzería in the heart of Buenos Aires.
  - [Perón](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WzwXAUqSgWJvaYWw5): Tipical Restaurante with an ambience refering a very popular political period of Argentina

### Interesting places to visit
I believe this list requires a separated page. [Here](./places_to_visit.md) I prepared a list with my favorite ones.

### Language: Spanish
The oficial language is Spanish with a weird accent for people that are not used to it. Therefore I made [this quick guide](./language.md) for you.
