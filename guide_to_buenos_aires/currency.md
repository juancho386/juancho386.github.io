## Currency
- The local currency is Pesos (ARS)
- Locals love US Dolars and Euros because they can make a difference on the exchange in the cuevas (see bellow)
- Any other currency is almost unknown for the locals
- If you dare to go adventurous, ask for local "cuevas" where you can exchange at a better rate. Bear in mind that the cuevas are not legal but commonly used
- Fake currency was not common. But ChatGPT says that now a days it could be.
- If you need to an ATM, use only ATM machines that are inside the banks
