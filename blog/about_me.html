<h2>List of things that are useful to know about me:</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<ul>
<li>I love scuba diving. You can have very long conversations with me about it.</li>
<li>I born in 1979. So do not refer to me as milenial because technically I am GenX.</li>
<li>I born in Argentina but not in Buenos Aires. So do not refer to me as Porteño.</li>
<li>I love to walk barefoot everywhere. Even in the office.</li>
<li>I prefer to walk or bike over any motor vehicle except trains: I love train trips.</li>
<li>I have two sons. I do not talk much about them but I love them blindly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical</h3>
<ul>
<li>I love to solve real problems. Not to make managers happy.</li>
<li>In an office style job I am only happy with a Linux machine (any distro) and a Bash console.</li>
<li>I consider any windows machine an XBox with Office and permanent mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li>I consider a Mac setup a restricted Photoshop environment that works as a playground for Linux users wanna bes</li>
<li>Primary law: The less amount of companies involved in a solution, the better.</li>
