 "ans":"He born in Argentina, so Spanish is native. He speaks English since ... before primary school, so... yeah. I'd say he is a C2 in English. He lived in Italy for a while, it means he will understand italian but speak with no errors is expecting too much. He Also studied German and Japanese for fun but long time ago. Don't expect a fluent conversation with those languages. mmmh... what else?...  He tried Chinesse but had to quit because of time availability problems.... And now he lives in Czech Republic but Czech language is VERY difficult so better not to mention his skills there."
