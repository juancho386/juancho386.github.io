},{
 "qs":["what about telecentro123?","what about telecentro 123?"],
 "ans":"Telecentro 123 was the first place I have been working. Actually it was a family business and a very interesting story: When I was a kid, my mother had a backery. Business went well so she expanded to an small deli-style shop. After many years, big supermarket companies took over the city and every single small business went for bankroupt. Desperated, my mother started to look for a different business and the telephones cabines market was growing. People needs to make phonecalls but there was no landlines nor cell phones in the area; and then they went to these shops. My role there was pretty much the IT guy. Wiring, patching, installing hardware and software; and cashier."
},{
 "qs":["what about mtss?"],
 "ans":"MTSS stands for Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social. It is the governamental entity that regulates legal work and social security in Argentina. It was a very temporary job because it was at the end of a very specific political period of the country. My job there was a data entry position. After the inspectors visit companies looking for ilegal work, they send their data to the department where I was to be processed."
},{

 "qs":["what about pinnacle?"],
 "ans":"Pinnacle Systems Latam was the Latin American distribution branch of the Miro/Pinnacle graphic boards. The regional manager had the idea of creating microservices for internet necesities. The project was an absolut disaster, but it was fun and a lot of learning... And I meet my wife there."
},{
 "qs":["what about rcc?"],

},{
 "qs":["what about tenroses?"],
 "ans":"TenRoses SRL was the company I have been forged. I still have many MANY good friends from there. Full of paralell thoughts and an awesome comunity, it was worthy of a best seller book. I started as frontend developer with XSL/XML. Then I moved to PHP 4 and PHP 5 which I still love. No composer nor manager's garbage. Pure love and good code. We had also a project for the Californian (USA) government; and I heard Arnold Schwarzenegger in a call once. :)"
},{
 "qs":["what about hrsmart?"],
 "ans":"HR stands for human resources. HR Smart used to be a company who created a HR software in PHP 5. I was dev there. The software tryed to be awesome but the team was very inconsistent. They paid well but money was not enough. Too many people with high ego doesn't make a good place to be 8 hours per day."
},{
 "qs":["what about atobiz?"],
 "ans":"AtoBiz was a developers company. The main business was getting argentinian devs and sell the product in Netherlands. The owner was a nice very tall dutch guy. Sadly the clients were unmanageable disasters"

},{
 "qs":["what about vostu?"],
 "ans":"Vostu requires a full chapter or a full book in the IT industry library. Long story short: I started my Devops/Infra path with a very nice BI team. You know... doing some ETLs. It was a huge company. They used to make facebook farming games. But somebody made big mistakes and they were found guilty of copying copyrighted material from Singa. The entire company went bankroupt. Very sad."
},{
 "qs":["what about panarea?"],
 "ans":"Panarea Digital wanted to be the first company providing learning platform for iPads in highschools and universities. I made a lot of automation and Nagios monitoring in there. I also setted up one of the first autoscalling engines in AWS before the AWS Autoscalling Group were a thing. All manual stuff. I am honestly proud of my achievements there."
},{
 "qs":["what about aerius?"],
 "ans":"Aerius Tech was a project involving drones and special security cameras to guard trucks from the sky. A big argentinian crisis forced the company to close the project before it sees the day light. I built (mostly) the web interface with geo location tracking system and the cam views."
},{
 "qs":["what about northdiving?"],
 "ans":"After Aerius, I decided to emigrate from Argentina. I worked as freelancer for a while and learning to be Scubadiving Instructor.

},{
 "qs":["what about teracloud?"],
 "ans":"Teracloud is a GREAT AWS Partner who welcommed me in the path of Full DevOp Engineer. I found very good friends, high quality code and a large learning path to keep growing. I'd stayed with them, but the economic situation didn't allow me to. My partner was moving to Prague and we couldn't get an agreement. Very sad. But I still have friends!"
},{

},{
 "qs":["what languages does juan speak","what languages juan speaks"],
 "ans":"He born in Argentina, so Spanish is native. He speaks English since ... before primary school, so... yeah. I'd say he is a C2 in English. He lived in Italy for a while, it means he will understand italian but speak with no errors is expecting too much. He Also studied German and Japanese for fun but long time ago. Don't expect a fluent conversation with those languages. mmmh... what else?...  He tried Chinesse but had to quit because of time availability problems.... And now he lives in Czech Republic but Czech language is VERY difficult so better not to mention his skills there."
